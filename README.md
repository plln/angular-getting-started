AngularJS snippets from ng-newsletter, codeschool mostly for my reference.

Instead of manipulating the DOM "directly", you annotate the DOM with metadata (directives),
and Angular manipulates the DOM for you. 

Ideal for single page apps. It is not a library but a framework for building dynamic web pages.
It focuses on extending HTML and providing dynamic data binding.
